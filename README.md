Making Redis from scratch

Will start off basing it from https://build-your-own.org/redis/

Probably in C++? Since I want to continue practicing it while its still fresh.
Based on what I hear about the original design of Redis, it was kind of a preference, and in general
what I hear is that C in general just creates a lot cleaner code especially compared to amateur C++.

C++ has a lot of features, and a lot of power, but usually used in the wrong way, to create overall worse code structure. I'll try to avoid this. I also hear skill issues with OOP. I'll also hopefully avoid and learn from this.

Follow good C++ practices, and good OOP practices

C++ Style Guide: TBD
    - compile with g++ -Wall -Wextra -O2 -g
    - -Werror can be used as well. Turns warnings into errors
    - "-O2" flag is an extra layer of optimization and error checking at the same time.

OOP Standards: TBD as well. Atleast SOLID principles. Are there any more? I'll see tomorrow
