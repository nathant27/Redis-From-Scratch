Ended up just writing notes. But I personally think its better to understand first and then start coding. Atleast understand to some extent.
Tomorrow, I will finish reading and will start coding

I'm familiar with Networking in C, but I'm not familiar with networking on C++.
I wonder how different it is, which I'll look up tomorrow as well. I'm getting tired.
