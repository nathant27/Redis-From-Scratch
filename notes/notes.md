# Redis Notes

In memory key value store.
Mostly used for caching bc memory is faster than retrieving from disk

Helps get rid of some slow DB queries

Cache server is map<string, string> over network
BUT Redis value can be any data structure. Hash, list, or sorted set.
    - Allows for more complex use cases: ranking, list pagination, etc.

Redis is called a data structure server
